Study subject RNA is extracted from paired tumor and adjacent normal tissues specimens for gene expression analysis. The dataset contains 54675 genes on sixty paired samples, 60 of which are cancer expressions and the other 60 samples are normal expressions of genes. Genes are Affymetrix expression arrays in each row, all probe sets represented on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Set are identically replicated on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.
